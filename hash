Hash has a fixed length.
Same data always maps to same hash.
Different data always maps to a different hash (within practical limitations).
Is easy to compute.
Is infeasible to convert hash to data.
A small change in data leads to a large change in hash.


A valid hash for a blockchain is a hash that meets a certain requirement. 
For this blockchain, having three zeros at the beginning of the hash is the requirement for a valid hash.

The number of leading zeros required is the 'difficulty'.
